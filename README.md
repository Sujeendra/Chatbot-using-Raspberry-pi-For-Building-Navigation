# Chatbot-using-Raspberry-pi-For-Building-Navigation
Chatbot using Raspberry-pi to navigate inside the building or apartment 
In the master branch there was a problem with multithreading that is multipe user can connect but each will recieve the same message eventhough a single user request for a Navigation details.Once any one of the user asks for the navigation details all will be delivered with the same message. So in this new branch i have added a code to securely send message to a particular user and automatically that user get disconnected.


Our Client app is built using MIT App inveneter......
Here I will be uploading the .aia file where the algorithm for list picking for different options required for navigation is written and even design of the app can be changed. Database can be changed according to the building location details.


Apk of the app can be downloaded by building the app in mit app inveneter website.

Import the .aia file not zip file on mit app inventer if you wish to change.
